This app for Annawon should have resources to allow users to educate themselves about their culture.
I should inspire them to track and find out who they are so they can feel proud of who they are.

It's should educate users about Wampanoag culture.

It should allow users to schedule events with Annawon and see his availability (maybe with Calendly?).

It should allow Annawon to post links and posters to events he will be attending, as well as updates and educational resources he wants to share.
This should be as easy as posting to instagram.

It should have a portal that takes users to first light fashion.
