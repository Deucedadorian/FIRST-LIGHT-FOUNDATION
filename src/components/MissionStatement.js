                  All across the globe, society is constantly evolving. Keeping up with modern trends can easily 
                  take the place of longstanding traditional values. Our goal at First Light Foundation is to highlight 
                  the importance of celebrating diversity.&nbsp; Promoting healthy minds, bodies &amp; spirits through 
                  environmental resources, educational programming &amp; cultural arts, we approach identity from all angles. 
                  Seven generation preservation, all across Turtle Island &amp; beyond. We strive to spark new light on the 
                  road to a brighter future, for all our relations. We thank you for supporting our cause and invite you to 
                  take part in building a strong foundation for our future to stand on.
