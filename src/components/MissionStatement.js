                  environmental resources, educational programming &amp; cultural arts, we approach identity from all angles. 
                  Seven generation preservation, all across Turtle Island &amp; beyond. We strive to spark new light on the 
                  road to a brighter future, for all our relations. We thank you for supporting our cause and invite you to 
                  take part in building a strong foundation for our future to stand on.
