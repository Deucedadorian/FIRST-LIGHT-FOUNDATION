          All across the globe, society is constantly evolving. Keeping up with modern trends can easily 
          take the place of longstanding traditional values. Our goal at First Light Foundation is to highlight 
          the importance of celebrating diversity.&nbsp; Promoting healthy minds, bodies &amp; spirits through 
          environmental resources, educational programming &amp; cultural arts, we approach identity from all angles. 
          Seven generation preservation, all across Turtle Island &amp; beyond. We strive to spark new light on the 
          road to a brighter future, for all our relations. We thank you for supporting our cause and invite you to 
          take part in building a strong foundation for our future to stand on.
